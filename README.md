# Spotify-Ad-Muter
This is a bot that detects if an ad is playing and mutes the ad when detected

This bot controls the mouse, so you will need to run it with admin cmd

Spotify desktop app needs to be always showing on the screen for this to work.

Only a handful of ad lengths are saved and stored in the pics folder, if an
ad of a different length is given and is not in the pics folder, you will need to
snip the ad length just like the other ad length pics and save it to the folder. You
will then need to add it to the adLengths list in the main function.

You also need to click the total length of the ad value to set it to the 
total length of the ad, not how much time is left in the ad.
